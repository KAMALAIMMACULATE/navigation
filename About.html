<p class="who">Who Iam</p>
<p class="about">An motivative information technical student at AkiraChix who has always been <br>learning how apps work to solve different problems and solving  them through making wireframes, web pages and mobile apps <br>coding using different programming languages like JavaScript, HTML/ CSS and UI/UX design. These above skills  helped me <br>in participating in school projects like creating an app for a Green Kiosk sells fruits and vegetables online and the project<br> is in progress not yet accomplished. I believe that these skills will help me in creating more things. I would like you to<br> take me as an entry-level UI/UX Designer.</p>

I would do anything for my family and everything, I do is basically looking out for their needs.</p>
