Over the past 8 months I begun to code and it's been nothing but life changing. During this time, I started learning how apps are created and the process of solving different problems. So far, I can make wireframes, web pages and mobile apps to name afew. Some of the programming languages i can code in include: JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Python and Kotlin. As the end of the year approaches, I'm in the midst of creating a Green Kiosk where the sale of fruits and vegetables can be purchased online. The project is currently under construction but i'm looking forward to putting my skills and knowledge to the test with this exciting challenge. </p>
