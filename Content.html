<h1 class="nav">HAVING SELF CONFIDENCE</h1>
<div class="one">
<h3 class="two1">What is self confidence</h3>
<h3 class="two">Confidence is being in the state that makes you feel that you can achieve what you want in life. That you have the capabilities, the will and the way to live your life according to your own values and beliefs without stopping to think what others will say or think about you.</h3>
<h3 class="two">It is the state that makes you a leader of your own self and not a follower to others. Where you will acknowledge your own success and will stop comparing yourself to others.

Confidence does not mean that you think of yourself as more valuable than others or better than others or even higher than others. People who think that way actually think very low of themselves. They feel weak and shaky from inside and just want to cover that fact by putting on their high ego mask</h3>
<h3 class="two1">Only when you are confident you will be</h3>
<ul class="ul">
  <li>Positive</li>
  <li>Energetic</li>
  <li>Powerful</li>
  <li>Successful</li>
  <li>Appreciating your self</li>
  <li>Knowing and acknowledging your true Self Worth</li>
  <li>Non-Judgmental</li>
  <li>Having deep levels of self-awareness</li>
  <li>Accepting who you are</li>
  <li>Believing that you are unique</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="two1">Only when you luck confidence, you will be</h3>
<ul class="ul">
  <li>Doubtful</li>
  <li>Shaky</li>
  <li>Undeceive</li>
  <li>Uncertain</li>
  <li>Have low self-esteem</li>
  <li>Have a high ego</li>
  <li>Negative</li>
  <li>Weak</li>
  <li>Judgmental</li>
  <li>Defensive</li>
  <li>Lack inner peace</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="two1">How I am going to build my Confidence</h3>
<ul class="ul">
  <li>Know your strengths and weaknesses. Write a list of things that you are good at and things that you know need improvement. Discuss your list with friends and family as, inevitably, they will be able to add to the list. Celebrate and develop your strengths and find ways to improve or manage your weaknesses.
</li>
  <li>We all make mistakes. Don't think of your mistakes as negatives but rather as learning opportunities.
</li>
  <li>Accept compliments and compliment yourself. When you receive a compliment from somebody else, thank them and ask for more details; what exactly did they like? Recognise your own achievements and celebrate them by rewarding yourself and telling friends and family about them.
</li>
  <li>Use criticism as a learning experience. Everybody sees the world differently, from their own perspective, and what works for one person may not work for another. Criticism is just the opinion of somebody else. Be assertive when receiving criticism, don't reply in a defensive way or let criticism lower your self-esteem. Listen to the criticism and make sure that you understand what is being said so you can use criticism as a way to learn and improve. See our page: Dealing with Criticism for more information.</li>
  <li>Try to stay generally cheerful and have a positive outlook on life. Only complain or criticise when necessary and, when you do, do so in a constructive way. Offer others compliments and congratulate them on their successes. You may find our page Offering Constructive Criticism helpful
</li>
  <li>Avoid Arrogance
Arrogance is detrimental to interpersonal relationships.

As your confidence grows and you become successful, avoid feeling or acting superior to others. Remember - nobody is perfect and there is always more that you can learn. Celebrate your strengths and successes, and recognise your weaknesses and failures. Give others credit for their work - use compliments and praise sincerely. Be courteous and polite, show an interest in what others are doing, ask questions and get involved.

Admit to your mistakes and be prepared to laugh at yourself!
</li>
  <li>Start a task or project that you've been putting off for a long time. Often we put off starting important tasks because they seem overwhelming, difficult or awkward to complete. Simply making a start on such a task can boost confidence and make you more inclined to complete it
</li>
  <li>Stand up and ask a question at a public meeting or in a group. By doing this you are making yourself the centre of attention for a few minutes.
</li>
<li>Volunteer to give a presentation or make a speech. For many people speaking to a group of people is a particularly scary prospect. The best way to overcome this fear and gain confidence is with experience.
</li>
<li>Introduce yourself to somebody new. This could be somewhere where people have something in common - like at a party or a conference, making it potentially easier to have a conversation. Or you could talk to a complete stranger in a lift/elevator.
</li>
<li>Take an unfamiliar journey on public transport. Travelling to a new place using an unfamiliar route and with random people will make most people feel at least slightly uncomfortable.

How do you feel about each of the ideas on the list above? Perhaps some gave you minor feelings of butterflies whereas others filled you with dread. Although the list uses common examples of potentially confidence-boosting tasks none may be right for you. Think of some confidence targets that are right for you - then start with easier ones and build up

</li>
</ul>

  <li>Take Risks</li>
  <li>Lower your ego</li>
  <li>Celebrate your wins</li>
  <li>Acknowledge yourself</li>
